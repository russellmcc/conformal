# Build audio plug-ins with Rust and TypeScript!

This repo contains a nascent framework for building audio plug-ins in Rust and TypeScript! The working title of this framework is "Conformal".

See our [documentation website](https://russellmcc.github.io/conformal) for information about how to use thie framework.

Right now this project is just in the beginning stages, so there's plenty of limitations. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
