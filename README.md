# Welcome to the Conformal Framework and Bilinear Audio Plug-ins

This repo contains _alpha_ software!

## Repo organization

Currently we have two top-level folders:

- `framework`: This includes framework code that we hope to grow into a general-purpose framework for building audio plug-ins in Rust and TypeScript. The working title for the framework is "Conformal".
- `plugs`: This includes a collection of open source plug-ins built with the Conformal framework. The working title of this collection is "Bilinear Audio".

When the code in the `framework` folder becomes ready to publish, we will likely spin off the plug-in collection into a separate repo.
