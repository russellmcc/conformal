# A collection of open-source audio plug-ins!

This repo contains a collection of open-source audio plug-ins written in Rust and TypeScript. This is currently alpha software with plenty of limitations and limited documentation!

The working title of this collection is "Bilinear Audio".

## Plug-ins

Currently we've implemented two plugins:

- Poly-81: an analog-modeled synthesizer loosely based on a budget-conscious synthesizer from 1980s Japan.
- Chorus-R: an analog-modeled chorus effect loosely based on the chorus circuit from a different budget-conscious synthesizer from 1980s Japan.
