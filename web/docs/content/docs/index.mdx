# Welcome to Conformal!

Conformal is a framework for building audio plug-ins using Rust and TypeScript.

If you're new, why not start by [building your first plug-in](/docs/tutorials/first-plug-in)?

Not sure about Rust and TypeScript? [We think you'll be surprised](/docs/concepts/why).

The documentation consists of a few sections:

- **Tutorials** walk you through building with Conformal — start here if you're new.
- **Concepts** explain the big ideas behind Conformal and why it works the way it does.
- **Guides** help you accomplish specific tasks.
- **Reference** has the full API details for when you know what you're looking for.
