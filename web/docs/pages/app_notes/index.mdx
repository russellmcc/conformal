# Application Notes

This section of the site contains "notes" on specific techniques in plug-in development to help you get the most out of Conformal. Think of this as a technical blog focused on plug-in development in Conformal. Each note varies in length and depth, and may require some prerequisite knowledge.

Like the rest of the site, we encourage contributions and corrections!

We also encourage discussion on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/russellmcc/conformal/discussions) page.
