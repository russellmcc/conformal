# Quick Start

This guide is a concise list of steps to get started building with Conformal. For a more detailed walkthrough on building a plug-in, see the [first plug-in tutorial](/docs/tutorials/first-plug-in).

## Creating your first project

<Steps>
### Install `bun`

[`bun`](https://bun.sh) is the TypeScript runtime we use for all build tooling in Conformal.

```sh copy
brew install oven-sh/bun/bun
```

### Install the VST SDK (Recommended)

While the VST SDK is not required to build plug-ins, we use it for validating plug-in correctness.

```sh copy
mkdir -p ~/SDKs && git clone https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk.git ~/SDKs/vst3sdk --branch v3.8.0_build_66 --recurse-submodules
```

### Create a new project

```sh copy
bun create conformal my_project
```

This will prompt you for a few questions to set up your project.

### Setting up development environment

We have a few steps that are required to set up your development environment. The following commands should be run from the project directory.

```sh copy
echo "VST3_SDK_DIR=$HOME/SDKs/vst3sdk" > .env
bun install
bun run bootstrap
```

### Building the project

```sh copy
bun run package
```

</Steps>
