# Welcome to Conformal!

Conformal is a framework for building Audio Plug-ins using **TypeScript** and **Rust**.

We're just getting started building this Framework, and there's a lot left to do! We currently support VST3
**Effects** 🎛️ and **Synths** 🎹 on macOS, but we hope to support more platforms, plug-in formats
and plug-in types over time! If you want to help out, contributors and collaborators are very welcome!

If you're new, why not start by [building your first plug-in](/docs/tutorials/first-plug-in)?

## Documentation organization

The documentation consists of a few sections:

- **Tutorials**, step-by-step guides to help you _learn how to build_ with Conformal.
- **Concepts**, high-level explanations of concepts involved in Conformal.
- **Guides**, step-by-step guides focused on _accomplishing a specific task_
- **Reference**, detailed information about Conformal's *API*s

Of these, we expect **Tutorials** and **Concepts** to be the most helpful for learning about Conformal,
while **Guides** and **Reference** will be more useful as you're building.

Currently all of these areas are pretty sparse 🏜️ and contributions in any of these areas are quite welcome!

## Getting Help or Providing Feedback

Conformal is ✨*brand new*✨, and documentation remains a work in progress 👷👷👷.
We understand that documentation is a critical component of a framework, so we're committed to making it better.

If you have an idea for how to improve the documentation or would like to contribute, please start a
discussion on GitHub! To make this easier, each documentation page has "Give us feedback" and "Edit this page" links in
the right sidebar; we encourage you to use these to help us improve!
