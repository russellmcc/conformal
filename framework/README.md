# Build audio plug-ins with Rust and TypeScript!

This repo contains a nascent framework for building audio plug-ins in Rust and TypeScript! The working title of this framework is "Conformal".

We currently only support the VST3 format on macOS, but we hope to add support for other common formats and operating systems over time.

Right now we're just in the beginning stages, so there's no documentation and plenty of limitations. Feedback is welcome!
